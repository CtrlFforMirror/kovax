      <h1 class="who-are-we">Who are we?</h1>
      <p>Kovax are a hard rock / alternative band from Leeds,     combining the alternative groove of bands like Deftones with the huge choruses of Bring Me The Horizon and the raw aggression of Reuben.
        <br>
        <br>
        The band started in late 2015 as an itch that couldn't be scratched, as music in the back of the mind that couldn't be ignored. Five months, some secret shows and a debut single later, Kovax launched in early 2016 with a four day tour to boot, impressing the likes of Christian Carlisle (BBC Radio Sheffield) and headlining Leedsâ€™ own Double Denim.
        <br>
        <br>
        After the successful release of their first single Godot and b-side Marigolds Kovax are further cementing their place in the Leeds scene through their lively and dynamical yet heartfelt live show with gigs around the north of England.
        <br>
        <br>
        <i>"I took a chance on Kovax, they were very new and I hadn't seen them live, but they put on a great live set and I'd happily book them again. Fantastic musicians with a very promising future ahead."</i> - Christian Carlisle, BBC Radio Sheffield
        <br>
        <br>
        <i>"Godot is a mighty first listen to Kovax and a hint that we might just be getting in on the ground floor of something special with it."</i> - The RingMaster Review
